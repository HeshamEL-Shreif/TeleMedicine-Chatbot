There are warning signs

Shortness of breath

A common symptom in most heart failure patients, you should
monitor your breathing and see if there are any changes that may
occur. You may notice an increase in shortness of breath during
the night, lying on your back, and you may need more pillows to

raise the upper part of your body to overcome this problem

When you feel shortness of breath, lack of endurance and lack of
activity, you should contact your doctor for advice or go to the
nearest hospital when you feel severe and persistent shortness of
breath

Fainting or dizziness

It may be caused by reduced blood flow to the brain and sudden

loss of consciousness due to the heart's inability to pump blood

failure and acute heart failure

is most common, with symptoms appearing slowly over time and

Living with heart failure

Reduce the amount of salt in your food

The Heart retains an excess amount of salt and water, which
leads to fluid buildup in the body
Eat more fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products

Control your fluid intake

Retention of water and salt leads to an increase in the
amount of fluids in the blood, which makes the heart work
harder to push this increase, so you must take care not to
replace this water by taking additional fluids. The doctor
recommends the quantity that you should eat on a daily
basis, and this quantity ranges from one and a half to two
liters

Avoid foods rich in fat

It may result in an increase in cholesterol and fats in the
blood, which may lead to a heart attack or heart failure.
High-fat foods such as full-fat dairy products and red meat
should be avoided
