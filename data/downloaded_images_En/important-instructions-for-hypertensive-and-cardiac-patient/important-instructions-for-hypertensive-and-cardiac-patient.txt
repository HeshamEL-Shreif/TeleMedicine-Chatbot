The heart is responsible for pumping blood to other
body organs. It is a very distinguished muscle that has
to continue working forever.

The heart consists of two sides: the right side and the
left one, each side has two rooms; the small one called
Atriums and the bigger one called ventricles and
separates them a barrier of muscles.

Using two large veins, the blood flows from all over
the body to the right Atrium and then pumped into
the right Ventricle. The right Ventricle pump the blood
into the lungs and there the blood gets filled with
Oxygen, then the blood goes from lungs to the left
Atrium and then goes to the left Ventricle which
pump the blood back to the rest of the body through
the Aorta artery.

The heart beats spontaneously and in coherence as
there are special cells in the Atriums that generate the
electrical current.
